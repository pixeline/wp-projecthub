# wp-projecthub
A Wordpress Theme that makes it easy to create elegant projecthubs (as advised by Brad Frost)

## How-to ?
This theme turns a wordpress install into a Projecthub: 
- "posts" become "project updates", and "categories" become "Projects".
- frontpage shows list of Projects for logged in users.

## What does it look like?
Clean, lightweight (no webfonts nor decoration) and elegant.

### Front page

### Inside a project - the projecthub

## what is missing?
- if you want to restrict projects to specific users, you may need to use a plugin that does that.

## What is a Projecthub ?
To quote Brad Frost: <blockquote>It's a centralized index page containing a chronological list all your project’s key design and development materials.</blockquote>
